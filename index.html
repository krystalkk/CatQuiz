                <p>Care4cats is a website dedicated to prospective first-time cat owners. Having a cat is more than owning something adorable and fluffy. It is a lifetime commitment that requires your companionship, care, and responsibility. Think of your cat as your best friend or your partner. </p>
                <p>Today, more and more people are choosing cats as their first pets, believing that kitties are much more self-sufficient than other pets.</p>
                <p>Indeed, they require less time and maintenance. Yet raising a cat and caring for it can be overwhelming for first-time owners who have zero experience with pets.</p>
                <p>Before taking a cat home, ask yourself the following questions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do I really want a cat or am I simply looking for a pet?</li>
                    <li>Am I ready to take responsibility for my cat’s well-being?</li>
                    <li>Am I capable of providing a home for him/her and fulfilling his/her needs?</li>
                </ul> 
                <p>If the answers are “yes”, congratulations! Welcome to the community of cat owners. </p>
                <p>But keep in mind that raising a cat is harder than you think and that there’s much more to learn about your cute little friend. As a first-time cat owner, I adopted Sushi (a two-month-old kitten) while knowing very little about how to properly care for him. I spent a long time researching and asking fellow cat owners for help.</p>
                <p>Nonetheless, I panicked when Sushi was sick and couldn’t fall asleep just because he could not get used to his new home. This situation lasted for months until I was more experienced in dealing with contingencies and Sushi’s daily needs. Now, Sushi is one year old and living his best life. Yet I never ceased to learn more about him and his habits.</p>
                <p>To avoid the same situation that happened to me, I developed the following 8-question test for potential cat owners in New York City. The questions feature very fundamental knowledge of cat care. They are the least you should know before taking a cat home. The purpose of this test is not only to measure the “eligibility” of first-time cat owners but also to provide insights into basic cat-raising.</p>
                <p>To guarantee our kitties’ well-being and health, this test is advised for all new cat owners. </p>
